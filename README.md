# Real estate price prediction

- In this data science project I developed a machine learning model to predict real estate prices in Bengaluru city.
- Tested performance of linear regression, SGDregressor, lasso and decision tress regressor.
- Through hyperparameter tuning using gridsearch cv I observed that linear regression model performed the best, having 84% accuracy on the holdout dataset.
- In preprocessing of the data using business logic removing of various outliers was done.
- As a result number of samples were reduced from 13320 to 7239.
